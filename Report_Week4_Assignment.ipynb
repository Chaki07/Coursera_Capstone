    "### Columbus is a fast growing city. In June of 2016 Columbus won a grant from the Department of Transportation totaling 40 million dollars for the Smart City initiative. This is one of many business ventures Columbus has taken on. With that said, the private sector has been growing too. Because of that, the demand for many types of resteraunts has increased. Columbus is home to many cultural cuisines. Japanese, Chinese, Indian and Mediterrainean cuisines are commmon place in Columbus. It's a great place to grow a restauraunt business."

Then I will use folium to find the best place to put a Greek Resteraunt.  I won't want to have two Greek Resteraunts close together. Then after I show that data in a dataframe, I will show in a folium map the venues to make it easy to see the clusters and understand where the most populated areas are. Then I will pitch the best site to build a resteraunt on.\n",

    "### Based on my intial findings it appears the the best location for a greek resteraunt would be in the east quadrant closest to Bexley. 1. Bexley is an area of population where most families are upper middle class and would have discretionary income to be able to go out to eat. They like fine dining and so you could make the Greek resteraunt cater to the needs of the location. This location would also bring in business from the southeastern quadrant of Central Ohio. Mainly the Pickerington, Canal Winchester areas."

    "# Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Since Bexley has a afluent community and there is not a Greek Resteraunt near it, I believe that Bexley would be an ideal location to build a new Greek Resteraunt. If you market it as high quality and stand by that and build a loyal customer base, this resteraunt would be highly successful in this area."
